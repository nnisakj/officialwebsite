<h2>Nnisa KJ</h2>


   <div><p>My name is Khairunnisa binti Mustapakama. I was born in Mentakab, Pahang Darul Makmur. 
I was raised by my grandmother since I was 4 years old until I reached the age of 8 and had moved to 
Selangor to live with both my parents when I reached the age of 9 years. I was born on December 27, 
2001 and I am the first and eldest child in the family and have four siblings.
    My hobbies are reading books, writing song lyrics, painting and writing blogs. I tend to
 be an introvert personality because I prefer to interact with a few people and I really love myself. 
I also really appreciate the people around me.</p></div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
   <div><p>First of all, thanks to Allah SWT for His mercy and His guidance in giving me a lot of strength in facing hard time in complete this assignment.
 Even though  there is a lot of complicated term that I do not really understand during completing this assignment but praise to Allah, I have managed to finish this on time.

<p>Next, I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who provided me the possibility to complete this assignment by giving all the support and 
guidance to me to finishing this complicated task. A special gratitude I give to my lecture, Encik Mohd Firdaus bin Helmi, as my lecturer of Introduction to Web Content Management and Design (IMD311) subject 
and mentor as he already taught me more than I could ever give him credit for here and also helped me to coordinate my project especially in finishing the web designed.</p>


<p>Beside that, I would like to thanks go to the most importantly, nobody  has been more important to me in the pursuit of this assignment than the members of my family.
 I would like to thank my parents, whose love and guidance are with me whenever I pursue. They are the role models.
Lastly, also not forgetting to thanks to all my friend that help me a lot by giving me the valuable information related to this assignment.
 Not only that, I also thanks them because keep support me in making much improvement in my assignment. Thank you very much.</p></div>
